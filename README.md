## What is EasyOCR?
EasyOCR, as the name suggests, is a Python package that allows computer vision developers to effortlessly perform Optical Character Recognition.It is a Python library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that allows you to easily extract text from images and scanned documents. In my project I am using easyOCR to extract text from business cards.

When it comes to OCR, EasyOCR is by far the most straightforward way to apply Optical Character Recognition:

* The EasyOCR package can be installed with a single pip command.

* The dependencies on the EasyOCR package are minimal, making it easy to configure your OCR development environment.

* Once EasyOCR is installed, only one import statement is required to import the package into your project.

* From there, all you need is two lines of code to perform OCR â€” one to initialize the Reader class and then another to OCR the image via the readtext function.
